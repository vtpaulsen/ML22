    "## Exercise 1: Neural Network Design (Don't spend too much time)\n",
    "In this exercise your task is to design neural networks by hand that compute simple functions.\n",
    "For the nonlinear transform you can mix them any way you like but you can only use, identity, sign, relu and sigmoid transforms in the neurons.\n",
    "You can make the networks as wide and deep as you would like but small networks are sufficient.\n",
    "* Make a network that computes $c \\cdot x$ for any constant c\n",
    "* Make a network that computes xor of inputs $x_1$ and $x_2$, when $x_1, x_2 \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ ($x_1$ xor $x_2$ is $0$ when $x_1$ and $x_2$ are equal, and it is $1$ otherwise).\n",
    "* Make a network that computes max($x_1$,$x_2$)\n",
    "* Make a network that computes $x^2$ - for any integer x in the set {2,3,4,5} <b>(Might be hard so skip if waste too much time)</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hint 1: It may be easier to find an easy mathematical expression that solves the problem and then to make a network that implements that**\n",
    "- **Hint 2: It suffices to use just relu and identity activations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SOLUTION MATH HERE\n",
    "A single neuron. Weights c. Activation is identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In first layer: One neuron with weights (1,1) and bias -1, taking ReLU. Another neuron with weights (-1,-1) bias +1, taking ReLU. Output layer one neuron with weight (-1,-1) and bias 1, identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In first layer: One neuron with weights (1,-1), taking ReLU. Another neuron with weights (-1,1) taking ReLU. And a neuron computing the sum of the two inputs using weights (1,1), identity. Output layer has weights (1/2,1/2,1/2) and identity. Observe: Sum of first two neurons in first layer is max(x_1,x_2)-min(x_1,x_2). Adding x_1+x_2 cancels out the smallest and leaves twice the max. Dividing it all by 2 gives the desired result.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a small network testing whether x = y. This is done by having two neurons, one having weight -1 and bias +y and another having weight 1 and bias -y. Both have ReLU. If x=y then both are 0. Otherwise, one is 0 and one is >= 1. Now create a new neuron taking the two previous as inputs with weight -1000 on both and bias y^2, taking ReLU. This becomes y^2 iff x=y, and otherwise it becomes 0. Do this for every y in 2,3,4,5 and create a neuron with weight 1,1,1,1 summing these and using identity.\n",
