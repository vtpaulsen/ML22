    "## Exercise 1: AdaBoost and VC-dimension\n",
    "In this exericse, we will investigate the VC-dimension of voting classifiers and argue that one has to be careful with the number of iterations of boosting to guarantee good generalization performance with high probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will consider is one-dimensional, i.e. a single feature. Our weak learner is decision stumps, i.e. a base hypothesis $h$ can be specified by a splitting value $v$, and two leaf values $a, b \\in \\{-1,1\\}$. Given a one-dimensional feature vector $x = (x_1)$, the hypothesis $h$ returns $a$ when $x_1 \\leq v$ and it returns $b$ otherwise. We let $H$ denote the set of all such decision stumps, i.e. $H$ is the set of base hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VC-dimension of base classifier\n",
    "1. Show that the VC-dimension of $H$ is $2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SOLUTION MATH HERE\n",
    " 1. First consider two points in 1d with coordinates 1 and 2 respectively. For any labeling, we can create the decision stump that splits between them and assigns the correct labeling in each leaf. So VC dimension at least 2. For three points $x_1 \\leq x_2 \\leq x_3$, observe that it is impossible to construct the labeling $(-1,1,-1)$, so VC-dimension at most 2.\n",
    "### END SOLUTION\n",
    "\n",
    "### VC-dimension of voting classifiers\n",
    "Let $C$ be the class of all voting classifiers over $H$, i.e. $C$ consists of all hypotheses of the form:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\textrm{sign}(\\sum_{h \\in H} \\alpha_h h(x))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We will show that $C$ has infinite VC-dimension. To do so, we will argue that for any size $n$, there is a set of $n$ points $x_1,\\dots,x_n$ in 1d that can be shattered, i.e. for any labeling $y \\in \\{-1,1\\}^n$ of the $n$ points, there is a hypothesis $g$ in $C$ such that $g(x_i)=y_i$ for all $i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. First argue that for any interval $[a, b]$ and value $z \\in \\{-1,1\\}$, it is possible to find decision stumps $h_1,h_2$ such that for $x \\in (a, b]$, we have $h_1(x)+h_2(x) = 2z$ and for any $x \\notin (a, b]$, we have $h_1(x) + h_2(x) = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SOLUTION MATH HERE\n",
    " 2. Let $h_1$ return the value $z$ for all $x \\leq b$ and the value $-z$ for $x > b$. Let $h_2$ return $z$ for all values $x > a$ and $-z$ for all values $\\leq a$. Then for $x \\leq a$, we have $h_1(x) + h_2(x) = z - z = 0$. For $x \\in (a, b]$, we have $h_1(x) + h_2(x) = z + z = 2z$. Finally, for $x > b$, we have $h_1(x) + h_2(x) = -z + z = 0$.\n",
    "### END SOLUTION\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use what you showed in 2. to come up with a 1d data set of size $n$ that you can shatter, i.e. generate any possible dichotomy/labeling using a voting classifier from $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SOLUTION MATH HERE\n",
    " 3. Let the points $x_1,\\dots,x_n$ have coordinates $1,\\dots,n$. Then for any labeling $y$, form intervals $(i-1/2,i+1/2]$ around each point and use 2. to find two hypotheses $h^i_1, h^i_2$ that returns $y_i$ in $(i-1/2,i+1/2]$ and $0$ outside. The classifier $f(x) = \\textrm{sign}(\\sum_i h^i_1(x) + h^i_2(x))$ generates the dichotomy $y$.\n",
    "### END SOLUTION\n",
    "\n",
    "### Growth function for few base learners\n",
    "Finally, consider if we restrict ourselves to only using voting classifiers that combine the predictions of no more than $T$ base hypotheses. To simplify the exercise, we will even assume that we use precisely the coefficients $\\alpha_h=1$ for the $T$ hypotheses. That is, we consider the set of voting classifiers $C^T$ containing all hypotheses of the form:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\textrm{sign}(\\sum_{i=1}^T h_i(x))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $h_1,\\dots,h_T$ are hypotheses from $H$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we have generalization bounds in terms of the growth function $m_H(n)$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Pr[|E_{out}(h^*)-E_{in}(h^*)| > \\varepsilon] < 8m_H(2n)e^{-\\varepsilon^2 n/8}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the growth function $m_H(n)$ when $H$ is the set of decision stumps on 1d data?\n",
    "\n",
    "### SOLUTION MATH HERE\n",
    "4. $2n$. For a set of $n$ distinct points $x_1 \\leq \\cdots \\leq x_n$, there are up to $n-1$ splits between the points, and for each such split, we can assign either $+1$ to the first part and $-1$ to the second part, or vice versa (ignoring the case where both sides are assigned the same label). Finally, there are the two labelings where every point is assigned either $+1$ or $-1$, giving a total number of labelings of $2n$.\n",
    "### END SOLUTION\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is a good upper bound on the growth function $m_{C^T}(n)$?\n",
    "\n",
    "### SOLUTION MATH HERE\n",
    "5. $(2n)^T$. For this, consider any set of $n$ points. We know that $m_H(n) \\leq 2n$. This means that for any $f(x) = \\textrm{sign}(\\sum_{i=1}^T h_i(x))$, there are only $2n$ distinct labelings that the $h_i$'s may choose from. Hence there are no more than $(2n)^T$ distinct $f$'s that can be generated.\n",

    "## Exercise 3: Gradient Boosting by Hand\n",
    "In this exercise you must complete one step of gradient boosting with exponential loss on a small 1d data set (X, y) as shown below. The exponential loss is $L(h(x),y) = e^{-yh(x)}$.\n",

    "   \n",

    "The loss function is exp(-y h(x)). Computing gradient wrt. h(x) gives -y * exp(-y h(x)). Evaluating this at 1 and -1 gives the following gradients using that h(x)=1 for all x: $(-1/e, -1/e, -1/e, e, e)^\\intercal$. The vector $\\hat{y}$ is thus $(1/e,1/e, 1/e,-e,-e)^\\intercal$.\n",

    "First leaf has two elements with label 1 and already predicting 1, hence best return value in the range is 1 (minimizing 2*exp(-1*(1+v)). For the second leaf, we have elements with labels 1, -1, -1 and current prediction 1. If predict v in this leaf, then exponential loss on these become exp(-(1 * (1 + v)) + 2*exp(-(-1 * (1 + v))) = e^(-v) * 1/e + e^v * 2e. The derivative is -1/e * e^(-v) + 2e * e^v. Setting to 0: 2e * e^v = 1/e * e^(-v) <=> v + ln(2e) = -v + ln(1/e) <=> v = (1/2)ln(1/(2e^2)) = -1.35.\n",

Concretely, in any iteration, once we have computed the best regression tree using least squares loss, gradient boosting would alter the leaf values to minimize the loss.
